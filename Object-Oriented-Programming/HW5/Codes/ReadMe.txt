I couldn't understand that sentence : "Test each function of each class at least once by writing driver code." clearly.So, i created a menu and a playGame function.
If you need to load a file in order to test my code, you can first select "PLAY" on menu then type "LOAD x.txt".
At that menu function i created 5 different AbstractHex pointer arrays to test global function for checking validity.
Also, You can compare 2 boards.(I use == and () operator both)
