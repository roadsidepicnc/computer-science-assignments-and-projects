I couldn't create a menu function for testing my code.I tested my code on maain function.Because of the time factor.
You need to type a key to continue testing other class functions.
When you type a random key it will test next type(Like ArrayList<Integer> then, ArrayList<String> then, LinkedList<Integer> ...).
You need to compile test.java to run my program.
I created javadoc files and put the files in "javadoc" file.
